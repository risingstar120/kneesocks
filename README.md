*Put some nice SOCKS on your HTTP only program*


# Motivation

Driven by my burning desire to tunnel `npm install` requests through a SOCKSv5 proxy (eg. [shadowsocks](http://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html)). Since `npm` only support HTTP proxy, I wrote this simple command line module to fire up a HTTP Proxy server, then use it to tunnel requests to my SOCKS proxy.


# Features

* Supports HTTP and HTTPS requests
* Built-in DNS cache
* 150 loc, does nothing else


# Install

`npm install kneesocks --production -g`


# Usage

`kneesocks port1 port2`, eg. `kneesocks 10001 10002`

* `port1` is the port your HTTP proxy server listen to on localhost.
* `port2` is the port of your existing SOCKS proxy, also on localhost.

Then you can set your npm config:

* `npm config set http http://127.0.0.1:10001`
* `npm config set https-proxy http://127.0.0.1:10001`

To revert proxy config, use `npm config delete http` and `npm config delete https-proxy`.


# Limit

Probably not the best solution for day-to-day browsing, due to lack of error handling and websocket support.

If you don't mind building binaries, use [DeleGate](http://www.delegate.org/delegate/) or [Polipo](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/polipo/) instead.
